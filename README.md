# Spectral Data Collector
This is an application that can collect data from an Ocean Optics spectrometer and transmit a reference and absorbance.
This application is meant to be a socket server for our [Spectral Data Viewer App](https://github.com/samfoucart/oueecs_SpectralDataViewer) to transmit data from the spectrometer to the app.

## Project
This project is made for Ohio Universityâ€™s Program to Aid Career Exploration and is supervised by Wojciech Jadwisienczak. During the Spring 2019 semester, I am in charge of creating an Android application that can be used to collect data from an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrometer. This program is built, ran, and tested on a raspberry pi 3B+.

## Dependencies
This project is dependent on the [SeaBreeze API](https://sourceforge.net/projects/seabreeze/). Instructions for building SeaBreeze are included in the building from source instructions.
